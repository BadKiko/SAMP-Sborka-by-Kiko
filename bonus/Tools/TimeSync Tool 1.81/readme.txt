New in this version!
--------------------
* Total Weather Control!
* Flickering sky problems fixed!
* GTA:SA 1.01 patch support!
* TimeZone making time go back before 00:00 no longer causes problems!

Info
----
What this tool does is modify the clock in GTA:SA to provide real time play. To use it simply run the tool, and then run GTA:SA (leaving TimeSync Tool running in the background), though it is possible to do it the other way round if you decide you want real time in the middle of your game.

It works by accessing the GTA:SA ram, disabling the clock update routines and setting the time accordingly. You can also adjust the timezone you want the game to be in.

Have Fun!
