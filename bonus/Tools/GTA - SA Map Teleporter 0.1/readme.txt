GTA:SA Map Teleporter - Version 0.1 ALPHA - (c) syc0 2005
==========================================================
Warning! This hack working only with game version 1.0!


Release Notes
=============
	v0.1	Initial release.

WARNING: This trainer is not guaranteed to be bug-free. I recommend that you backup save games before using it.
I will NOT be held responsible for any data loss or damage caused by use of this trainer.


Instructions
============
Start GTA:San Andreas. Load the trainer and press the enable button.
You can now use the in-game map to teleport. Right-click the map to set your location. Press the disable button to restore normal operation.


Notes
=====
* If you enable the patch and close the trainer, you will not be able to disable it. This is NOT a bug, to fix this would require me to embed Rockstar's code in the trainer.
* This will NOT work while in a vehicle (but it will with the jetpack).
* Your Z co-ordinate isn't changed, so you may find that you spawn underneath the ground or high above the ground.
* The best way to teleport is to activate the jetpack cheat (type 'ROCKETMAN' in the game), go as high as you can, then teleport.  


Known bugs/Limitations
======================
* At the moment, you have to press the right-mouse button twice to teleport, as the game still thinks you are setting the marker. I hope to fix this in a future release.

Next version
============
* Hotkeys to enable/disable.
* Bug fixes
