PLAYER SWITCHING v1.1
Author: mcsim2401
Description: Sometime I played in games that was ability to switch control to any character. When I learned GTA SA scripting, I decided to make a same thing in GTA San Andreas and here it is - my most detailed switching control script.
Code takes 500 lines, but this is only begining, the fun is yet to come! Script features:
- Weapon and ammo synchronization
- Ability to swich control on mission (now on "DEMO" stage)
- Clear wanted level when switching (next wanted sync)
and other things. You can look ChangeLog.TXT for more information.

Keys:
- To switch control from CJ (main player) to some other nearest pedestrian, use "Tab" + "Num 0"
- To switch control back to main player, use "Tab" + "Num ." (Num Del)

Installing: Just extract file PSv11_BasicScript.CS to game folder - SA/CLEO. Before this, make sure you have CLEO 4 intalled (recommended to install the last version - 4.1, that you can download from http://cleo.sannybuilder.com/?lang=en)

Copyright: You can host this script free, but you should specify the author. You can not host changed archive!
