GTA SA: TALK WITH PASSERS (CLEO)
Author: mcsim2401
-----------------
Hello, I present to you my second script. Certainly, seen talking pedestrians on the street, you may think that CJ can talk with them too, but this is impossible. This script allows player to talk with the pedestrians like they talking with each other. Almost all dialogues has been voiced on both side (but some passers not preset voice, see below). Also I make this mod more usefull - talking increases health (Disabled for any time) and sexiness.
Using: Walk to any passer and use key combination "Tab" + "T" and hold it for 1 second. This script not working when player wanted by police, driving or on mission.
Known Issues:
- Some dialogues may be isn't correct, because I can't find completely suitable.
- Not all passers preset voice. Some of they are silent during the dialogue.
Installing: Put file TalkWithPassersMod.cs in SA Game Folder/CLEO. Before this make sure you have CLEO installed (I use CLEO 4).

Change History:
v1.1 Hotfix
- Fixed gamegrash at the last CJ's dialogue. Removed health increasing for any time (that was a reason of gamecrash)
- Fixed wanted level cleaning.
v1.0
- First Release
