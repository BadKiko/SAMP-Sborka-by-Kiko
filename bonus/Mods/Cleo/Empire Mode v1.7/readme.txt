This mod adds a Vice City Stories Empire style way of making money in San Andreas.
Each business pays off their own amount each day (16:00). Businesses to own are
Doherty Garage (Unlocked after Yay Ka Boom Boom), Zero RC (Small Model Army),
Wang Auto's (Puncture Wounds), Four Dragons Casino (Breaking The Bank at Caligula's),
Madd Doggs Manager (End of the Line).

Two buisiness related missions have been added to the garage and Wang Auto's.

Install
=======================================================================================================
This should be very simple if you have installed a CLEO mod before.

1. Make sure CLEO 3 or higher is installed.

2. Take all the .cs files and place them inside the CLEO folder in your game installs main directory.

3. Take all the .fxt files and place them inside the cleo_text folder inside of the CLEO folder. (if there isn't one already, make one)
