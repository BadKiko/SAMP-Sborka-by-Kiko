\*----------BEGIN MODIFICATION INFORMATION-------------*\
\\ This is analog speedometer, along with gasoline system and nitro usage dial. All components are illuminated, so
\\ they'll light up at night. It also features additional boat speedometer, fuel warning & nitro usage lamp, and
\\ broken glass effect if you damage your vehicle.
\\ There are 2 graphic designs available: Default texture is "retro" looking one with metal edges and red illumination
\\ and the alternative one is transparent-black with blue illumination. Unlike the other design, this one doesn't have
\\ any glass damage, and it comes with both MPH and KPH.
\\ If you want to disable speedometer, press "delete" button.
