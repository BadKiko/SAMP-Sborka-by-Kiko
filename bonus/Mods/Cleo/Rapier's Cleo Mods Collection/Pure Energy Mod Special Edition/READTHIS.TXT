ƒ ƒ ƒ PURE ENERGY MOD SPECIAL EDITION by Rapier ƒ ƒ ƒ

PEM is a reference to PMM 2 and brings eight special powers to be used in different situations. When you start the game, you will have no powers yet, however, to use the powers you must activate it. When active, you'll see smoke on the CJ's head. Open "COMMANDS.TXT" to see the commands list.

WARNING!
