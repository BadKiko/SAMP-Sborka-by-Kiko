***** Installation
Make sure you are using one of the following gta_sa.exe versions:
	1.	GTA San Andreas v1.0 [US] HOODLUM No-CD Fixed EXE:
	EXE size:  14 383 616 bytes
	
	2.	GTA: San Andreas v1.01 [EURO] No-CD/Fixed EXE:
	EXE size: 15 806 464 bytes

Remote lock car is fully compatible with both of them, 1.0 US and 1.01 Euro No-CD shortly.
	
// It requires CLEO4 Library

 If you haven`t CLEO4 Library then download it from here: http://cleo.sannybuilder
Then:
- Add all required files to GTA San Andreas directory.
- By default RemoteLockCar.ini is configured to use numpad as set of keys.
So that if you don`t have numpad or would like to use laptop version:
- Open CLEO\RemoteLockCar.ini
You see named sections such as NUMPAD and LAPTOP, possible to have more.
To select what set (section in ini) of keys Remote lock car will use edit  [MAIN] >> selected_keys
By default it is:
selected_keys = NUMPAD

It is not everything, if keys don`t match to you, you can edit existing set of keys (NUMPAD or LAPTOP) or add new one. Now it is no problem.


***** Usage (after you installed mod)
Run the game.
Go to your favorite car. Read controls about remote control, lights, radio, doors, siren, bonnet, door components and engine.
After you exit car you can still control it. Read about proper keys for your installed version (numpad or laptop version).
Your last car doesn`t disappear until you to new one or car is wrecked.

***** Changes since 3.5 version:
- Now Remote lock car is fully compatible both with:
	1. GTA San Andreas v1.0 [US] HOODLUM No-CD  Fixed EXE
	2. GTA: San Andreas v1.01 [EURO] No-CD/Fixed EXE
- Turn_off_the_engine_after_player_exits_car option in .ini file didn`t work, because i forgot to write a code for this.
  Now it works.
- CAMERARESTORE now really works to restore camera view behind the player.
