Introduction
------------
This program flips the status of the censorship in GTA San Andreas.
Uncensored version has extra action after a date with the girlfriend.

Usage
-----
If the program is run without command-line parameters then it will try to find
GTA: SA window and if successful will show you the current status of censorship.
You will then be prompted to flip it. Type your answer and press Enter to proceed.
After the program is done, suring the next date you'll have a chance to 'drink coffee'
inside the girlfriend's house if she invites you. If you save the game, the censorship
status will be saved as well.

If you specify a file name in command prompt then the rpogram will treat it as GTA:SA
save-file. It will display the censorship status of the save file and will prompt you
to flip it. Note that the program accepts any file as input and does not do any checks
regarding file format. So it is your responsibility to apply it only on GTA:SA save files.


NOTE: The program will only work with save-files based on default main.scm. If the script was
recompiled, the address of the censorship flag is likely to be changed; therefore, the program
will modify different location. It cannot detect such situations and will corrupt your save files.

NOTE 2: Use at your own risk and make BACKUP first.
